                <p>   
                    Zack grew up in Lexington, Kentucky and completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Pennsylvania.   
                    Upon graduation, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue a career in the music business. After four very fun
                    years of touring and session work, he followed his then-girlfriend (now wife!) to Cincinnati, Ohio.

                <p>
                    While music is still a big part of his life, he turned his attention to the business world in Cincinnati. 
                    He joined a microbrewery in its nascent start-up phase and quickly worked his way up to Sales Director... the 
                    brewery, Rhinegeist, grew into one of the 50 largest craft brewers in the country during his tenure. He was
                    interested in owning his own business, so he left Rhinegeist to start One Green Liter, a boutique wine import
                    company focusing on organic wines in sustainable packaging.

                <p>
                    After seven years in the adult beverage industry, he wanted to pivot to a new field - while still leveraging
                    the sales, marketing, and management know-how he had acquired in his previous professional life. He took the plunge
                    and enrolled in a full-stack coding bootcamp with the goal of building creative, practical, and insightful web
                    applications. Please follow the PORTFOLIO link to learn more!
